/**
 \brief Applies an approximate gaussian blur using a dual filtering approach.
 \details Use a downscaled pyramid approach to approximate a gaussian blur with a large radius. 
 The input texture is downscaled a number of times, using a custom filter as described by Marius Bj√∏rge in the 'Bandwidth-Efficient Rendering' presentation, Siggraph 2015
 (https://community.arm.com/cfs-file/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-20-66/siggraph2015_2D00_mmg_2D00_marius_2D00_slides.pdf).
 The image is then upscaled again with a second custom filter.
